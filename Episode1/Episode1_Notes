Episode 1 Notes – Setting Up the Foundation

Welcome to Episode 1 of the Johnson Imports & Exports Salesforce series. In this episode, we laid the groundwork for our fictional international trading company by setting up the core data model and populating initial data. The aim was to establish a strong starting point for all future Salesforce processes.

Global Picklists

We created 3 global picklists to maintain consistency across objects:

| Global Picklist Name | Referenced In                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Country\_List        | Country\_\_c (Account), Source\_Country\_\_c (Lead)                                 |
| Language\_List       | Language\_Preference\_\_c (Contact), Preferred\_Communication\_Language\_\_c (Lead) |
| Currency\_List       | Deal\_Currency\_\_c (Opportunity)                                                   |

Note: Full values for all global picklists are stored separately in the file: global\_picklists.md

Sample Data Records

We created and inserted sample records for the following:

* Accounts: 10 fictional international trading companies
* Contacts: 13 contacts associated with different Accounts, with roles, WhatsApp numbers, and language preferences
* Leads: 10 international leads with estimated deal timelines and country/language origin
* Opportunities: 10 deals representing real-life logistics scenarios, complete with shipment types, currency, deal amount, and estimated dates

These records are stored in .csv format under:

* accounts.csv
* contacts.csv
* leads.csv
* opportunities.csv

Anyone who downloads the repository can directly use these files to import the same records into their own Salesforce sandbox or developer org.

Outcome

By the end of Episode 1, we have:

* Established a clean and scalable data model
* Introduced reusable global picklists
* Populated realistic starter data
* Made the org ready for Flows, Validation Rules, List Views, Reports, or further automation
