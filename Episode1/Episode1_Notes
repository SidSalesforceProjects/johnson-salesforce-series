Episode 1 – Setting Up the Foundation
Welcome to Episode 1 of the Johnson Imports & Exports Salesforce series. In this episode, we laid the groundwork by setting up the essential data model and creating realistic sample data across four key Salesforce standard objects: Account, Contact, Lead, and Opportunity. This gives us a robust foundation to build business processes in future episodes.

- Leads: 10 potential deals, capturing early-stage import/export interest
- Opportunities: 10 deals, capturing actual business transactions with details like shipment, volume, and currency

Outcome

By the end of Episode 1, we:
- Designed a scalable, international trading data model
- Introduced reusable global picklists
- Created rich, structured sample data
- Laid the foundation for automation, flows, and reporting

This puts us in an excellent position to dive into Episode 2, where we enhance the Lead object to support smooth conversion into Account, Contact, and Opportunity records.
